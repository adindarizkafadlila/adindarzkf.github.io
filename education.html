                            Starting in 2005, the SD Plus Bina Empat Lima learning building was built with the laying of
                            the first stone by the head of the foundation. The school building was completed in 2007
                            with 6 classes, 1 principal's office and 1 teacher's office. In 2010 the construction of the
                            library and UKS room was continued. Then in 2015, the building and school environment were
                            renovated, such as courtyards, ablution places, toilets, gardening, and school fences.
